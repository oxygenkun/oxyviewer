//! OxyViewer's format-neutral image metadata parser.
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! ```no_run
//! // Extract metadata tags from any supported image container.
//! let tags = oxy_metadata_parser::tags("photo.jpg").unwrap();
//! for tag in &tags {
//!     println!("[{}] {} = {}", tag.group, tag.name, tag.value);
//! }
//! ```

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Public surface
//
// The parser modules below are `pub(crate)`. They are implementation: nothing
// in the documented API returns a `pdf::xref::XRefTable` or asks for a
// `tiff::IfdEntry`, and making them public would commit every one of their
// ~500 items to semver - a refactor of the xref reader would be a breaking
// release.
//
// They were public for one reason: integration tests live outside the crate
// and can only see public items. That is the test layout dictating the API,
// which is backwards. The non-default `internals` feature re-exposes them
// under their real paths, and Cargo.toml turns it on for this crate's own
// dev-dependency, so `cargo test` works with no flag while a consumer sees
// only the API below.
//
// `internals` carries no semver guarantee. If you find yourself reaching for
// it from outside this crate, the thing you need is missing from the real API
// and should be added there instead.
